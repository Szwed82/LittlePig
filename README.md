# LittlePig

It’s a stripped-down version of the [LazyPig](https://github.com/Otari98/_LazyPig) addon that keeps only some of the functions from the original:
* Chat Filter for grey/white/uncommon/rare/epic roll messages
* World Chat Mute in Raids/Dungeons/BG
* Salvation Remover
* Mana Buffs Remover
* Loot Window Auto Position
* Resurrect Auto Accept

All the other functions are available in the [EasyLoot](https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/EasyLoot)  and [QuestRepeat](https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/QuestRepeat) addons by Marceline.
